## Principles of Web Development
Focus on the User
Focus on Quality
Keep It Simple
Think Long-Term (and Beware of Fads)
Don’t Repeat Yourself (aka One Cannot Not Maintain)
Code Responsibly
Know Your Field

## 1. Cognitive Load
Cognitive load refers to the total amount of mental effort being used in the working memory.

## 2. Emphasis
When you want to get a point across, it’s a good practice to use design to guide the user to the most essential information.

Emphasis is often a great strategy to do this — it can help users differentiate important text from supporting text.

However, without discipline, emphasis can actually get in the way of guiding the user to the most important information.    

## 3. Social Proof
Social Proof is a psychological and social phenomenon where people assume the actions of others in an attempt to reflect correct behavior in a given situation.

In advertising, companies often use testimonials from other customers as a form of social proof.

If other people have used this product and achieved their desired results, I (as a prospective customer) probably will too.

## 4. UI Interface Convention
User interface conventions are design patterns that users expect from a given interaction.

Whenever users have established an expectation of how to perform a certain action (i.e., I can return to the home page by clicking the company logo on the top left of a webpage), don’t diverge from that expectation without good reason.

In some cases, this effect is so strong that the context of user interface conventions actually overshadows the content of the message.
